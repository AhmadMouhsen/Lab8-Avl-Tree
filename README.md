# Lab8-Avl-Tree

Testing:
You have to provide 4 test scenarios in which all types of rotations will
occur. You will add all the nodes, then, you will print the tree level by level.
The print for each node will print (data, balance).

Deliverables:
Only the team leader will submit the GitHub link and the task description for
each team member. Along with your code, you will submit a PDF file that
shows the tree representations after adding the nodes.

I Ahmad worked alone.

The 4 test cases show the data of the nodes and the level of the nodes visually
in the console. For example if you inserted the data 3, 4, 2 into the tree and
printed the tree using the print method you would get:

3

2 4

The root is at the top with a height of 1, the children of the root are below with
a height of 2. They are also organized by how they would appear in the tree if
drawn greater being to the right and lesser being to the left. Of oourse with many
nodes it gets hard to tell if they are on the right or left side of the tree but it
shouldn't be that difficult to visualize.

The PDF will contian drawings of the 4 test cases of the before and after of the
insertions that caused the desired rotations.
